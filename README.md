# Predicting-Chicago-Taxi-Price

The taxi business in Chicago is dynamic, and it has become a more interesting field of study with the advent of ridesharing companies. This project aims to predict taxi fare in Chicago city. We explore and visualize our dataset to select features. Then, we use various regression techniques, and they were able to generate fairly accurate results.

The dataset was taken as a part of publicly available Chicago data, which can be found at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew/data.
